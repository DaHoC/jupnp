Prerequisites\r\n================\r\n\r\nThe build infrastructure is based on Maven in order to make it\r\nas easy as possible to get up to speed. If you know Maven already then\r\nthere won't be any surprises for you. If you have not worked with Maven\r\nyet, just follow the instructions and everything will miraculously work ;-)\r\n\r\nWhat you need before you start:\r\n- Maven3 from http://maven.apache.org/download.html\r\n\r\nMake sure that the \"mvn\" command is available on your path\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Checkout\r\n===========\r\n\r\nCheckout the source code from GitHub, e.g. by running\r\n\r\n````\r\ngit clone https://github.com/openhab/jupnp.git\r\n````\r\n\r\n3. Building with Maven\r\n======================\r\n\r\nTo build jUPnP from the sources, Maven takes care of everything:\r\n- change into the jupnp directory (`cd jupnp`)\r\n- run `mvn clean install` to compile and package all sources\r\n\r\nThe build result will be available in the folder `target`.\r\n","google":"UA-53876269-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
